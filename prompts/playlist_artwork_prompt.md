Create a single square image (1:1 aspect ratio). Generate one image only. Abstract, soft-focus gradient composition inspired by the current season. Large, blurred colour fields blend seamlessly into one another with no sharp edges or defined geometry. Select a colour palette, lighting atmosphere, and emotional tone appropriate to the current season (spring, summer, autumn, or winter). The seasonal influence should guide the hues and warmth of the image:

Spring: fresh, light, gently vibrant
Summer: bright, sun-washed, radiant
Autumn: warm, rich, softly deep
Winter: cool, crisp, airy and pale

Do not create multiple seasonal versions. Interpret only the current season and render one cohesive composition. In the foreground, include one softly abstract seasonal subject rendered in the same blurred, luminous style. The subject should be recognizable only through a very gentle silhouette suggestion, deeply out of focus, as if seen through frosted glass or shallow depth of field. No sharp detail, no realism — just subtle atmospheric form emerging through colour density and light. The seasonal subject should feel appropriate to the current season without being literal or highly detailed.

The entire image should feel airy, modern, and premium — like a tech or healthcare brand backdrop — balancing emotional warmth with refined minimalism. High-key, luminous aesthetic. Ultra-smooth creamy transitions. No texture, no grain, no noise, no crisp edges, no visible brush strokes.

No text. No letters. No words. No typography. No borders. No panels. Single image only. High resolution.
