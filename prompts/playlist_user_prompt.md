Generate a description for my weekly Spotify playlist.

Source week: {source_week}
Target week: {target_week}
Source week artists: {top_artists}
Source week tracks: {top_tracks}

The description must:

- Start with exactly one short, funny, sharply sarcastic roast of {first_name}'s music taste (insulting but playful; no profanity)
- Ground the rest of the paragraph in the source week listening data and how it informs the target week playlist
- End with a forward-looking sentence introducing what new tracks we're going to explore this week (e.g. "This week we're diving into...")
- Be one short paragraph, no emojis
- Return strict JSON with a single key: description
